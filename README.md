## Reusing this script 

## Why
Reusing this script will save time and resources if it is used in future elections in Colorado. This file should be saved and distributed to other teams working on elections across various type of elections in the area once the official counts are tabulated. 

## How
This script can be easily reused in any type of election because the variables are agnostic of this particular election. It acts as a shell for any data set organized the same way. 

### Example 1 -  
The variables that identify candidate and county are defined by column header (2 and 1 respectively). Therefore a file of the same organization can be swapped into this script and run using the same columns to determine the election results. 

Current: Candidate name in row 2, County name in row 1

To be: flexible variable and rows

To complete this update, you must be sure to update all mentioned of the original variables. Also, the script can be modified to adjust to the column number [1] [2] for the variable in questions per election.

### Example 2 - 
This script could also be modified to output a new data point: the percentage of â€¦voters eligible in the district / how many voters actually voted in that district. This is advised to give a full picture of the % split between districts and advise how 

To do this you could utilize a dictionary to store the total eligible voters in each county. This should give you the percentage of turn out in each district.
